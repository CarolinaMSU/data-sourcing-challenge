# data-sourcing-challenge

This was one of the hardest assignments I have worked on so far, and also the one that took me the longest to troubleshoot. I followed a similar process to what I have done before:
- Review documents and find the activities that have similar code.
- Copy/paste the code as found
- Update variables and names of lists, df's etc.

The hardest troubleshooting I had to do was with proper use of the .json() function. I re-watched the recording of when we did it but I had issues with it on the sections where it asked for it. I also re-watched the sessions where problems were covered during office hours but my errors were different than those of my classmates. 
While they had issues with the keys, and merge functions, for me it was the .json().
After I had typed the code and got the error in VS, I'd add that to ChatGPT and that helped me correct some syntax errors I made similar to last week, where I used the wrong (, [, or {.
I got the assignment as close to finished as I could and then signed up for office hours on 4/4. The errors that were causing me the most issue was not having ":" where needed in some code and then misspelling "genre" which caused issues with the variables in the last few steps of the activity. 
My last issue is that in some instances I used "Title" not "title" which caused a lot of issues so I went back with a Ctrl+F to find and correct them to the right syntax.

I was able to get throgh all the issues but was not able to figure out why my final list - before cleaning up the data - only brought back movies that are not in list, not some in the list which caused issues with the rest of the Clean Up data steps. I will follow up with professor on issue next week but did not want to wait another 4 days to submit assignment.
